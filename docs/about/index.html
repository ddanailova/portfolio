            <p> I work hard to provide the best quality in my work. I like to interact with people, and my travel
                experience has given me the ability to adapt easily to any environment, making me a fast learner
                and a good team player. I was raised to be polite and professional, and always take into
                consideration everyone’s opinion, and analyze carefully every aspect of my actions.</p>
            <p>During all my life, I did many interesting things. My first interest is traveling and experiencing
                new cultures. I believe that this kind of experience opens one’s mind, making him/her more
                adaptable and open minded, with much bigger horizons. I have several hobbies like gaming,
                mechanics, IT, PC building, cooking and used to breed dogs and tropical fishes, and I like to keep
                learning more and more. </p>
            <p>At school, although I belonged to the Electronics area, I used to participate actively in other
                areas as a volunteer, such as Biology, Arts and Sports. During big school events, I would always be
                part of the organization, taking care and managing technical, financial and entertainment. I used
                to be the captain of my gaming group, but due to traveling I stepped down but we are still family,
                playing together whenever possible, being one of the games Warframe. </p>
            <p>This makes me a very versatile person, with great learning, interpersonal and adaptation skills,
                which are most valuable in a work environment.</p>
